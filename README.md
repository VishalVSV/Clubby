## Plugins?
Clubby has a state of the art, ad hoc, dll based "plugin" system. Future councils can always just write a plugin for a specific use case and use the existing clubby framework.
If someone who knows how to code ever sees this, I'm very sorry for the plugin system. It may cause serious medical issues if taken seriously. My philosophy with code, at least with c# has been "If it works don't fix it".

## It even makes coffee!
